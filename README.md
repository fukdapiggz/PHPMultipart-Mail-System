> Multipart-Mail-System


On my days of exploring, StackOverflow. I noticed myself, and other's having trouble with Multipart emails. I have worked it out and would love to share my work with other's!

Feel free to remix my git repository, and customize my current code if you'd like. Please credit my my git repository.
